Conduct of Practical Examination:
• Experiment distribution
o For laboratories having only one part: Students are allowed to pick one experiment from
the lot with equal opportunity.
o For laboratories having PART A and PART B: Students are allowed to pick one
experiment from PART A and one experiment from PART B, with equal opportunity.
• Change of experiment is allowed only once and marks allotted for procedure to be made zero of
the changed part only.
• Marks Distribution (Courseed to change in accoradance with university regulations)
k) For laboratories having only one part – Procedure + Execution + Viva-Voce: 15+70+15 =
100  Marks
l) For laboratories having PART A and PART B
i. Part A – Procedure + Execution + Viva = 6 + 28 + 6 = 40 Marks

Number of Contact Hours/Week 0:2:2  SEE Marks 60
Total Number of Lab Contact Hours 36 Exam Hours 03
Credits – 2
Course Learning Objectives: This course (18CSL66) will enable students to:
• To make students familiar with Lexical Analysis and Syntax Analysis phases of Compiler Design
and implement programs on these phases using LEX & YACC tools and/or C/C++/Java
• To enable students to learn different types of CPU scheduling algorithms used in operating
system.
• To make students able to implement memory management - page replacement and deadlock
handling algorithms
Descriptions (if any):
Exercises to be prepared with minimum three files (Where ever necessary):
1. Header file.
2. Implementation file.
3. Application file where main function will be present.
The idea behind using three files is to differentiate between the developer and user sides. In the
developer side, all the three files could be made visible. For the user side only header file and
application files could be made visible, which means that the object code of the implementation
file could be given to the user along with the interface given in the header file, hiding the source
file, if required. Avoid I/O operations (printf/scanf) and use data input file where ever it is
possible.
Programs List:
Installation procedure of the required software must be demonstrated, carried out in groups and
documented in the journal.
1.
a. Write a LEX program to recognize valid arithmetic expression. Identifiers in the
expression could be only integers and operators could be + and *. Count the identifiers &
operators present and print them separately.
b. Write YACC program to evaluate arithmetic expression involving operators:     +, -, *,
and /
2. Develop, Implement and Execute a program using YACC tool to recognize all strings
ending with b preceded by n  a’s  using the grammar  a n  b  (note: input n value)
3. Design, develop and implement YACC/C program to construct Predictive / LL(1)
Parsing Table for the grammar rules: A → aBa , B → bB | ε . Use this table to parse the
sentence: abba$
4. Design, develop and implement YACC/C program to demonstrate Shift Reduce Parsing
technique for the grammar rules: E → E+T | T, T → T*F | F, F → (E) | id                and
parse the sentence: id + id * id.
5. Design, develop and implement a C/Java program to generate the machine code using Triples
for the statement A = -B * (C +D) whose intermediate code in three-address form:
T1 = -B
T2 = C + D
T3 = T1 + T2
A = T3

6.
a. Write a LEX program to eliminate comment lines in a C program and copy the  resulting
program into a separate file.
b. Write YACC program to recognize valid identifier, operators and keywords in the given text
(C program) file.
7. Design, develop and implement a C/C++/Java program to simulate the working of Shortest
remaining time and Round Robin (RR) scheduling algorithms. Experiment with different
quantum sizes for RR algorithm.
8. Design, develop and implement a C/C++/Java program to implement Banker’s algorithm.
Assume suitable input required to demonstrate the results
9. Design, develop and implement a C/C++/Java program to implement page replacement
algorithms LRU and FIFO. Assume suitable input required to demonstrate the results.
Laboratory Outcomes: The student should be able to:
• Implement and demonstrate Lexer’s and Parser’s
• Evaluate different algorithms required for management, scheduling, allocation and
communication used in operating system.
Conduct of Practical Examination:
• Experiment distribution
o For laboratories having only one part: Students are allowed to pick one experiment from
the lot with equal opportunity.
o For laboratories having PART A and PART B: Students are allowed to pick one
experiment from PART A and one experiment from PART B, with equal opportunity.
• Change of experiment is allowed only once and marks allotted for procedure to be made zero of
the changed part only.
• Marks Distribution (Courseed to change in accoradance with university regulations)
m) For laboratories having only one part – Procedure + Execution + Viva-Voce: 15+70+15 =
100  Marks
n) For laboratories having PART A and PART B
i. Part A – Procedure + Execution + Viva = 6 + 28 + 6 = 40 Marks

n n
E = P * (r(1+r) )/((1+r) -1)
where
E = The EMI payable on the car loan amount
P = The Car loan Principal Amount
r = The interest rate value computed on a monthly basis
n = The loan tenure in the form of months

The down payment amount has to be deducted from the principal amount paid towards buying the
Car. Develop an application that makes use of this AIDL service to calculate the EMI. This
application should have four EditText to read the PrincipalAmount, Down Payment, Interest Rate,
Loan Term (in months) and a button named as “Calculate Monthly EMI”. On click of this button,
the result should be shown in a TextView. Also, calculate the EMI by varying the Loan Term and
Interest Rate values.

the lot with equal opportunity.
o For laboratories having PART A and PART B: Students are allowed to pick one
experiment from PART A and one experiment from PART B, with equal opportunity.
• Change of experiment is allowed only once and marks allotted for procedure to be made zero of
the changed part only.
• Marks Distribution (Courseed to change in accoradance with university regulations)
q) For laboratories having only one part – Procedure + Execution + Viva-Voce: 15+70+15 =
100  Marks
r) For laboratories having PART A and PART B
i. Part A – Procedure + Execution + Viva = 6 + 28 + 6 = 40 Marks

Course Outcomes: The student will be able to :
• Identify the limitations of ILP and the need for multicore architectures
• Define  fundamental concepts of parallel programming and its design issues
• Solve  the issues related to multiprocessing and suggest solutions
• Make out the salient features of different multicore architectures and how they exploit parallelism
• Demonstrate the role of OpenMP and programming concept
Question Paper Pattern:
• The question paper will have ten questions.
• Each full Question consisting of 20 marks
• There will be 2 full questions (with a maximum of four sub questions) from each module.
• Each full question will have sub questions covering all the topics under a module.
• The students will have to answer 5 full questions, selecting one full question from each module.
